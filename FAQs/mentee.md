FAQ for participants of Technical Interview Preparation Meetup with WWCode-SV


Introduction
This meetup is for those who are preparing for technical interviews and we try to focus on solving problems and writing working solutions within limited time on whiteboard. Participants should be able to solve and write implementation of a simple problem within 5-7 mins. If you are not able to print all odd array items in backward order within 5 mins using any real language syntactically correct - we encourage you to study and practice more and attend our next session - we don't have enough mentors to spend time on this level problems. 


What is this series about:
* Preparation for technical interviews, focused on data structures and algorithms. 
* Solve problems in a mock interview setting
* Whiteboard and communicate with mentor on your approach to the solution. 


What do I do as a mentee:
* Study the week’s topic beforehand, know the basics. 
* Practice problems at home
* Volunteer in group to whiteboard a solution.  Explain solution and get feedback from mentor. 
* When not at whiteboard with solution, work on problem on your own or with others at the table using pen and paper. 


What happens on the night of the event:
* Check in using QR code
* Use QR code to access diagnostic quiz.  Take and give score to organizers for table assignment.
* Have dinner/network/socialize
* Lightning Talks will happen on Week 1, Week 4 and Week 7.
* Introduction to topic of the week.
* Separate to groups for whiteboarding practice.
* Conclusion/Summary Talk


Checkin Process:
* Scan Check-in QR Code
* Fill in name/email.
   * Email address is needed for sending you feedback forms and surveys for future events.  We keep emails to an on need basis only.
* Take Diagnostic Quiz
   * Answer YES if you can write a solution easily
   * Answer NO if you don't know how to write
   * Answer NO you may write a solution but you'll spend more than 7 mins
   * Answer NO you may write a solution but not sure if it is correct


Study Group Sign Up:
* Scan QR code for language specific data structure algorithm study group
* Email is required if you want to be contacted for study group formation.


Useful Practice Resources:
* leetcode
* Interviewbit
* Hackerrank

The main goal of this meetup is to practice whiteboarding skills like thinking out loud, writing a code on a whiteboard, and etc. We are expected participants to solve some interview questions on a given topic in advance.  For examples use sites like https://leetcode.com/p...­ , interviewbit.com, hackerrank.com or check the problems list from wwc-sf meetup: http://meetupresource...­ and the resource doc from WWC-SV Fb group (you need to be a member of the Fb group to see it) or that will help you to start. To better prepare, solve problems on paper instead of a computer/laptop.


Participants are split into 2 levels: intermediate or advanced. To define your level, you will be given a quiz with several problems on it. 
* Fill out the quiz for each problem based on the following criterias:


YES if you can write a solution easily


NO if you don't know how to write
NO you may write a solution but you'll spend more than 7 mins
NO you may write a solution but not sure if it is correct


* Count the number of YES. 
* Define your level according to the number of your answers.


After announcements and the topic overview, participants are divided into small groups of 3-5 people, a mentor and a room/whiteboard are assigned for each group. Every 25 mins mentors switch groups. Usually our mentors are ready to spent a couple more minutes at the end of meetup to answer your questions.


This technical workshop is intended for people who identify as women.
