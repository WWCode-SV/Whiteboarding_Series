WWCode-SV Interview Prep Series - Whiteboard Session
What is it?
* Each week, for about 2 hours, mentees get to come practice coding questions on a whiteboard. 
* Mentees are provided a question and then should explain their approach to solving it, code it, and give both time and space complexity analysis.


==================
TIME INVOLVEMENT
==================
How much time do  I need to dedicate?
* Approximately 2 hours for one evening each week.
* 1.5 hours is for actual  mentor/mentee interaction.  Another 0.5 hours at the beginning to enjoy dinner and network with others. 
* You can come volunteer for all 8 weeks, or just a couple of them.
When is the series starting/ending?
* March 11th  to April 29th.  Every Monday evening, from 6:45pm to 9pm. 
Where is the series held?
* ServiceNow has kindly offered to host us.
* Located in Santa Clara. (3250 Jay St. Santa Clara, California 95054)
* ServiceNow has its own parking lot, so you won’t have to deal with finding parking.
Do I have to be a mentor for all 8 sessions?
* Nope! Even just a couple or even just 1 session is fine.
* We’d love for you to be able to attend all 8 though, since the more mentors the better!  We understand if you can only make it to a few only.
What happens on the night of a session?
* Sign in
   * Mentees sign in and are given a couple of preliminary questions for them to determine what their level is. 
   * Mentors sign in so we know we’re not missing anyone and  have to do last minute replanning. 
* Introductions. 
   * Intros from our Host, mostly a few min for them to greet the participants and to recruit a bit. 
   * Topic intro.  Lightning presentation on the week’s topic to remind mentees important things to remember/know about. 
* Group split up.
   * Mentors and mentees will shuffle to their assigned groups. 
* Whiteboarding
   * Mentor briefly go over things to look out for in problem solving. 
   * Mentor poses a provided problem. 
   * Mentees try to solve the problem, either on own or as a group.  1 mentee volunteers to code and explain the problem solution on whiteboard. 
   * Mentor judges mentees problem solving approach and  coded solution.  Provide hints as necessary.  Give quick feedback to mentee. 
   * Repeat process with remaining problems. 
   * Mentor/mentees stay with assigned group for approximately 25min, and then rotation time will occur.  Mentors rotate to the next group of mentees.  We repeat this for the rest of the night.
Do I have to look for my own problems/solutions?
* Nope!
* We will email you a set of problems and the solutions before the session.  We plan on emailing it out to mentors the weekend before, so you can have enough time to study the questions/solutions. 
* If you want to provide another problem and solution that you think will be a good challenge, feel free!  If you don’t mind, feel free to provide us the problem/solution so we can have it for future mentees. 
Will I have to mentor the mentees outside of the weekly sessions?
* Nope!
* Your commitment is strictly for the couple of hours of the night that you have signed up for. 
* Mentees may, however, ask for contact info.  You may decide if you want to provide or not. 



===================================
Am I Qualified to be a Mentor? (Of Course!)
===================================
What are the topics covered?
* We try to cover all the fundamental topics that an interviewee should know prior to an actual interview. 
* Topics will be covered in the following order:
   * Arrays/Lists/Strings
   * Recursion        
   * Linked Lists
   * Stacks/Queues
   * Trees/Tries
   * Graphs
   * Dynamic Programming
How knowledgeable do I have to be to be a mentor?
* The more the better, of course!
* Fundamental knowledge of the topic, mostly just to be able to give mentees hints and know if their approach is on track. 
* We provide problems and solutions to you, so as long as you understand the solution and can explain it to mentees, you’re good!
* We know some of the latter topics, “dynamic programming”, and “graphs” are more advanced, but we really need help with those ones, so even if you think you may not know those as well as the basic topics like arrays, strings, etc, please don’t shy away from signing up as a mentor for those weeks.
Do I need to know a specific language?  
* Nope! As long as you know one  of the languages (Python, Java, C/C++, Javascript, Ruby, Swift,etc). 
* We have mentees of all backgrounds, so you may see code of a different language.
* Solution approach discussions can be pseudocode based and mentee can choose her own language to write the solution on whiteboard
Will I be paired up with mentees who code in a different language?
* Yes, very likely.
* Our mentees come from very mixed backgrounds, and we don’t have the capacity to group mentor/mentees based purely on just difficulty level AND language. 
* If you are paired with mentees who code in a different language, don’t worry. You just need to understand approximately at a higher level what the mentee is coding.
* If you are paired with mentee who is coding in a language that you happen to be an expert at, feel free to provide feedback on language specific details so mentees can be aware of common pitfalls.  
   * Ex.  Language specific memory allocation/deallocation, better syntactical ways of coding something, etc. 
How many mentees will I be paired with?
* We try to limit to 4-5 mentees per mentor.  
* # of mentees may change based on how many mentors we can find, and how many mentees show up. 


===================================
Who am I Mentoring? 
===================================
Mentees
* Each week, we post a meetup page for the event.  We limit to 60 participants, and we usually max out on that and more try to come.  If you do the math, it’s clear why we need your help to sign up as a mentor.
What are the mentees background?
* We have mentees of all backgrounds 
* Mostly females
   * Males - A few brave ones  come despite our heavy emphasis on female participants. (Based on California laws, we cannot explicitly turn away anyone). 
   * If you happen to have a male mentee in your group, please help us in the following ways:
      * Ensure that the male participant doesn’t code every problem,  dominate the conversation, or take away opportunities from any other participant. 
      * No mansplaining, or any other forms of condescending, patronizing behavior, from either genders. 
* College students looking for internship/full time
* Currently working software professionals looking for the next opportunity.
* Professionals trying to switch careers into software. 
* Professionals who have been out of industry, for whatever reason (Visas, maternity leave, etc). 
* Mentees just trying to refresh on topics
Can I let mentees take photos of the the problem sheet?
* NO. We have this common set of question/answers that we reuse in our series.  Encourage participants to google common problems of a particular topic.  That’s how these problems/solutions were obtained originally.
* Feel free to point them to any resources that you know of that they can find useful. 


===================================
Why should I mentor? 
===================================
What will I get out of it?
* It feels great to just give back.
* You like teaching.
* You want to refresh on interview skills yourself.
* Help with the tech industry’s lack of gender diversity. 
* We will happily provide you with any letters of recommendation, Linkedin references, volunteer thank you letters at the end.  We would like to recognize your generous efforts in helping move the needle!


=====================================
I’m so pumped and want to be involved more!
=====================================
* Super awesome!  Please contact us for your brilliant ideas!
* Please email your contact info to: sv@womenwhocode.com
* If you know of a host that can host us for these kinds of interview prep series, please let us know.  We are always looking for a host/venue!
