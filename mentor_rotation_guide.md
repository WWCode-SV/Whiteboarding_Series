* Role - a friendly, helpful interviewer, Goal - improve confidence of participants,
* Practice introduction(during 1st session), under 1min for each participant, give feedback
* Ideally - have a correct solution in 25 minutes, at least - have a brute force solution,
* Check that all involved in the discussion, Inforce talking out loud/through concept,
* Rotation - after 25 mins of a session make sure you spend next 5 min for giving feedback, switching the group. We start the next session right in 5 mins
* Short feedback - (common mistakes, patterns you have seen during the sessions)
* FAQ - “Do we share problems list?” - we don’t, we are reusing the problems. Suggest to explore websites like https://open.kattis.com/,  https://leetcode.com/ , https://www.interviewbit.com/, https://www.hackerrank.com/
